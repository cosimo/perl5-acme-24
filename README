NAME
    Acme::24 - Your favourite TV-show Acme module

SYNOPSIS
      use Acme::24;

      # Tell me some random quote about Jack Bauer
      print Acme::24->random_jackbauer_fact();

      # Returns an arrayref with 25 random facts
      my $facts = Acme::24->random_jackbauer_facts();

      # Every call collects 25 random facts in a text file
      # called `/tmp/superhero.txt'
      Acme::24->collect_facts('/tmp/superhero.txt');

DESCRIPTION
    This module was written because I'm somewhat crazy, and I'm also
    passionate about the 24 tv-show, but in particular of the
    B<KingOfTheAssKickers(tm)>, something between Duke Nukem and Chuck Norris.

BUGS
    One probably: this module should not really be on CPAN, it takes space,
    although fortunately only a little.
